# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices, specifically for **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**, using historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## âœ… Project Overview

Forecasting stock prices is a classic problem in time series analysis. This project aims to:
- Build a robust deep learning model to **predict stock closing prices** using past observations.
- Use **LSTM networks**, which are ideal for sequential and time-series data, to learn trends and temporal dependencies.
- Visualize actual vs predicted results and forecast the **next 10 days of stock prices**.
